## Fundamental Techniques for Dealing with Others  

### No Criticism, No Condemnation, No Complaints  

No one truly believes they are guilty.  

Criticism wounds the ego and awakens resentments that can last for decades.  

Any fool can complain, criticize, and judge.  

It takes character and self-control to be understanding and capable of forgiveness.  

A great person demonstrates their greatness in how they treat those with less power.  

### Show Honest and Sincere Appreciation  

We all need recognition, to feel important—it’s one of life’s great driving forces.  

The best way to bring out the best in people is through appreciation and encouragement.  

Nothing kills ambition more than the criticism of a superior.  

Appreciation is a fundamental necessity.  

Flattery is insincere, but appreciation is genuine. One comes from the heart, the other from the mouth. One is selfless, the other selfish.  

Ways to show appreciation:  
- Show genuine interest  
- Offer praise  
- Give congratulations  
- Express gratitude  

Hurting people does not change them. In fact, no one will ever thank you for it.  

"I shall pass this way but once; therefore, any good that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again."  

Every person I meet is superior to me in some way; in that way, I learn from them.  

Be warm in approval and generous in praise.  

### Awaken in Others a Burning Desire  

"When I go fishing, I don’t think about what I like—I think about what the fish prefer. Why not apply the same common sense when dealing with people?"

The only way to influence others is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.  

Action arises from fundamental desires, so to be persuasive, we must awaken a strong desire in others.  

The world is full of selfish, opportunistic people. That’s why those few who genuinely seek to help others have a huge advantage—there is no competition against them.  

Everyone should win. This should not be confused with manipulation, which implies winning at the expense of others.  

Self-expression is the dominant need in human nature.  

When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it’s ours, why not let them develop it themselves? They will consider it their own, like it, and use it.
