### **Fundamental Techniques for Handling People**

1.  **Don't Criticize, Condemn, or Complain:**
    * Avoid criticism, condemnation, and complaints. No one believes they are guilty, and criticism only generates resentment.
    * Be understanding and capable of forgiving, demonstrating greatness in how you treat others.

2.  **Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation:**
    * Recognize and value others genuinely. Appreciation is vital nourishment for ambition and personal development.
    * Be hearty in your approval and generous in your praise, differentiating sincere appreciation from selfish flattery.

3.  **Arouse in the Other Person an Eager Want:**
    * To influence, talk about what the other person wants and show them how to get it.
    * Arouse a frank desire in others, seeking win-win outcomes and allowing them to feel that the ideas are their own.

### **6 Ways to Make People Like You**

1.  **Become Genuinely Interested in Other People:**
    * Show a genuine interest in the lives and affairs of others.
    * Remember that people are interested in those who are sincerely interested in them.

2.  **Smile:**
    * A smile is a powerful expression that conveys happiness and warmth.
    * Smile when speaking, teaching, or selling, as it improves efficiency and the atmosphere.

3.  **Remember a Person's Name:**
    * A person's name is the sweetest and most important sound to them in any language.
    * Remembering and using someone's name is a subtle compliment that generates goodwill.

4.  **Be a Good Listener and Encourage Others to Talk About Themselves:**
    * Give exclusive and absorbed attention to the speaker.
    * Encourage others to share their experiences and problems; sometimes they just need to be heard, not an opinion.

5.  **Talk in Terms of the Other Person's Interests:**
    * Find out what your interlocutor enjoys and focus the conversation on those topics.
    * Talking about what they are passionate about is the royal road to their heart.

6.  **Make the Other Person Feel Important – and Do It Sincerely:**
    * We all yearn to feel important and appreciated.
    * Use small courtesies and sincere praise to make others feel valued.

### **Win People to Your Way of Thinking**

1.  **The Only Way to Get the Best of an Argument Is to Avoid It:**
    * Avoid arguments at all costs. If you win, you make the other person feel inferior and lose their goodwill.
    * Misunderstandings are resolved with tact, diplomacy, and a desire to understand, not with confrontation.

2.  **Show Respect for the Other Person's Opinions. Never Say "You're Wrong":**
    * Never tell someone directly that they are wrong, as this attacks their pride and judgment.
    * People have prejudices and do not easily change their minds if they feel attacked.

3.  **If You Are Wrong, Admit It Quickly and Emphatically:**
    * Admitting your own mistakes elevates you and disarms the interlocutor, who will likely adopt a forgiving attitude.
    * It is easier to hear criticism from your own lips than from others.

4.  **Begin in a Friendly Way:**
    * A "drop of honey" (sincere friendship) attracts more than a "gallon of gall" (scolding or threats).
    * Convince others that you are a sincere friend; this is the path to their reason.

5.  **Get the Other Person Saying "Yes, Yes" Immediately:**
    * Guide the conversation to obtain a series of affirmative responses from the outset.
    * Once a person says "yes," their pride compels them to be consistent.

6.  **Let the Other Person Do a Great Deal of the Talking:**
    * Let others talk about their achievements and experiences.
    * If you want friends, allow them to outdo you and share their joys.

7.  **Let the Other Person Feel That the Idea Is His or Hers:**
    * Make subtle suggestions and let others come to their own conclusions.
    * People like to feel that their ideas are their own and that they are consulted.

8.  **Try Honestly to See Things from the Other Person's Point of View:**
    * Strive to understand why the other person thinks and acts as they do.
    * Putting yourself in their shoes will save you irritation and improve your ability to deal with people.

9.  **Be Sympathetic with the Other Person's Ideas and Desires:**
    * Express understanding and empathy, saying: "I don't blame you for feeling that way; I would feel the same in your place."
    * Convert hostility into friendship with compassion and self-control.

10. **Appeal to the Nobler Motives:**
    * People usually have a "good and worthy" reason for doing things, in addition to the real one.
    * Appeal to their idealism and their desire to be considered honorable and just.

11. **Dramatize Your Ideas:**
    * Don't just state the truth; make it vivid, interesting, and dramatic to capture attention.
    * Present your ideas in a way that is memorable and attractive.

12. **Throw Down a Challenge:**
    * Stimulate healthy competition and the desire for self-improvement in others.
    * The game, the opportunity to express oneself, and to demonstrate one's worth are great motivators.
