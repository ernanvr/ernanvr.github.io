This page is a snapshot of what I am focused on right now.

## Learning

- Applied AI systems and product strategy.
- Startups, business model design, and execution discipline.
- Philosophy and frameworks for meaningful work.

## Writing

- Publishing once a week.

## Personal priorities

1. Build deep technical and strategic leverage in AI.
2. Grow a strong founder mindset through consistent execution.
3. Connect with people who think long-term and build for impact.
