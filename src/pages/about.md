I am in the early stages of building an AI services startup while working full-time. My long-term vision is to help make El Salvador a technology power by helping Salvadoran companies compete with strong, practical AI applications.

## My Journey

I started learning programming in 2021. I began with C and JavaScript, then expanded to TypeScript, Dart, and Python. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a serious focus on AI, startups, and business strategy.

Today I am exploring ideas through Santa Clarita Digital Labs, building prototypes, sharpening my technical and strategic thinking, and sharing what I learn in public.

## What I Write About

- AI and startups, including technical insights with a business lens.
- El Salvador's development and technology potential.
- Philosophy, happiness, and meaningful work.
- Personal growth and world-impact initiatives.

## Why This Blog Exists

I write to connect with like-minded people around the world.

I care deeply about transparency. You will find honest reflections about what I am learning, what is working, and what still needs to improve.

If you are building something ambitious, curious about AI, or interested in the future of El Salvador, I would love to connect.
