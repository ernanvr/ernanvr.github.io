This is my current stack and toolkit.

## Development

- TypeScript and JavaScript for web development.
- Python for AI workflows and experimentation.
- Dart for selected cross-platform app work.

## AI and product tools

- LLM APIs for prototyping and validation.
- Prompt iteration workflows for practical use cases.
- Lightweight automation tools for repetitive tasks.

## Writing and thinking

- Markdown-first workflow.
- Long-form notes for synthesis and strategy.
- Weekly writing cadence for consistency.

## Core principle

I optimize for tools that let me ship faster, think clearer, and focus on real value.
